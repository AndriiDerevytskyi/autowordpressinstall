					<b>Simple LAMP + WORDPRESS installation (unattended) over Ubuntu 16.04 LTS</b>


This shell script asks for simple questions regarding MySQL DB root user password, Wordpress User and DB etc in order to setup a running Wordpress install in Ubuntu 16.04

Versions of packages that will be installed:

1) Apache 2
2) PHP 7
3) MySQL 5.7
4) Latest Wordpress version from https://wordpress.org/download/

It was tricky to install MySQL un-attended due to various changes and also to set MySQL root password.

I've found a way around.

You are welcome to  tweak the script as necessary to include your required additions.

<b>Suggestions are always welcome :)</b>
